                <div class="title">Procedural Animations Using FABRIK</div>
                <a>
                    TGA offers a course were the student gets to specialize in an area in which they are intrested in.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    So I decided to specialize in procedural animations and developing an Inverse Kinematics alghoritm
                    using the
                    FABRIK (Forward And Backwards Reaching Inverse Kinematics) method.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    And with the finished inverse kinematics I wanted to recreate the subtle hand animations from
                    Uncharted 4: A Thief's End.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I made the project in my own custom C++ DirectX11 game engine.

                <div class="title">Why FABRIK?</div>
                <a>
                    I chose to use FABRIK because it is well-suited and optimized for game development. Unlike other
                    inverse
                    kinematics (IK) methods, FABRIK offers a balance between efficiency and accuracy, making it ideal
                    for
                    real-time applications where performance is crucial.
                    <br><br>
                    However, FABRIK does come with a significant limitation: it only works with positions, meaning that
                    rotations must be handled manually. This can add complexity when implementing it for 3D skeletal
                    animations
                    or other applications requiring precise orientation control.
                    <br><br>
                    Despite this drawback, FABRIK also stood out as one of the simplest IK methods to implement, making
                    it a
                    practical choice given the short timeframe of the course. Its ease of implementation allowed for a
                    faster
                    development process while still maintaining the necessary functionality for game-related
                    applications.

                <div class="title">FABRIK Implementation</div>
                <a>
                    The implementation of the position solving was straight forward. Perform the passes a number of
                    iterations. But I found that a single iteration is enough for my joint chain. But for larger joint
                    chains more iterations was needed.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    And you can also set a flag in the chain to decide if it should use the target local to its own
                    space, set it so it uses world space and the models transform.

                <a>
                    The FABRIK algorithm operates in two key passes to adjust joint positions efficiently:
                </a>

                <div class="subtitle">Backward Pass</div>
                <a>
                    The chain starts from the end effector and moves backward toward the root. This step ensures that
                    the
                    end effector reaches the target while maintaining segment lengths.
                </a>

                <div class="subtitle">Forward Pass</div>
                <a>
                    The chain then moves forward, repositioning joints while keeping the root in place. This step
                    restores
                    the structure while maintaining the target alignment.

                <div class="title">Joint Rotations</div>
                <a>
                    This part was the hardest to figure out, I struggled sometime with what space the positions would be
                    calculated in and which space would make the rotation calculations easier. But I solved it by coming
                    up with this solution!
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The SolveRotation step in FABRIK adjusts joint rotations after their positions are updated. It
                    iterates through each joint (except the last) to align it with the next joint in the chain. For the
                    last joint, I store a parameter withing the chain where you can chose your own rotations using euler
                    angles.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Using quaternions ensures smooth rotations and avoids problems like gimbal lock, maintaining both
                    correct positions and natural orientations.

                <a>
                    I took the physics engine I made in project 7 into my own engine and cast a raycast from the the
                    lower right side of the body and just set the target position of the inverse kinematics to the hit
                    point of the ray.

                <div class="subtitle">Improvements</div>
                <a>
                    Currently, the ray moves at a fixed distance from the body, which makes the animations feel
                    unnatural. Instead, I want the ray's origin to follow at a fixed distance while gradually correcting
                    its position to align with the center of the body over time. This smooth adjustment will create more
                    natural animations by preventing sudden movements and making the transitions feel more fluid.

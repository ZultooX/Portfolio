                    <br>
                    Began as a part of the Applied Graphics Programming course at TGA, but extended into my own interest
                    and something I started developing further on my own.

                    <br><br>
                    So the things that I will list is stuff I've done on my own, and not part of the course.

                    During the course of Applied Graphics Programming, I wanted a way to test different values, such as
                    lighting or camera settings, without needing to rebuild the engine each time. To address this, I
                    decided to integrate ImGui, a graphical user interface library, directly into my engine. This
                    allowed me to create sliders, buttons, and input fields for real-time adjustments of parameters like
                    lighting intensity or camera position while the engine was running. Using ImGui, I could modify
                    values and instantly see the effects without stopping the engine or recompiling. This made testing
                    much faster and more efficient, improving my workflow and reducing downtime during development.

                <div class="title">ECS</div>
                <a>
                    After we had a presentation about ECS, I wanted to learn more about how they functioned.
                    I implemented a way to store entities in pools, which the components then gets added to. This made
                    it so the components were stored next to eachother lowering the chances of cache misses.
                    <br><br>
                    Since in ECS the logic are in systems, i made an interface system which also makes so I can store
                    the ISystsem type.
                    <br><br>
                    After implementing ECS I understand how it works more working with only entities instead of
                    gameobjects. I much more prefer a component system were the logic is inside of the components. With
                    my current implementation the logic of multiple components is in the same system, which makes the
                    code unclear and hard to follow.

                <a>
                    I wanted to find a more efficient way to add textures and variables to the shader without the need
                    to create a custom
                    buffer for each one. During my research, I discovered that DirectX 11 provides a powerful feature
                    called shader
                    reflection. This feature allows you to reflect the data within the shader, which makes it possible
                    to read every texture
                    and buffer that is currently bound to the shader program.
                    <br><br>
                    However, I encountered a small challenge: variables had to be placed inside a constant buffer to be
                    properly reflected.
                    This required some extra setup on my part. Essentially, the reflection process looks for a specific
                    buffer—named
                    "PublicContainer"—which holds the necessary data for the shader. Once the reflection process
                    identifies this buffer, it
                    extracts the relevant data from it.
                    <br><br>
                    To further optimize performance, I decided to store the reflected data into a material file. This
                    file contains the
                    necessary information about the textures, variables, and buffers. By doing this, the shader doesn’t
                    have to undergo the
                    reflection process each time it is loaded, thus significantly reducing redundant computations and
                    improving efficiency
                    during runtime.
                    <br><br>
                    This method of storing material data makes the workflow much more flexible, as it eliminates the
                    need to re-reflect the
                    data on every shader reload. Instead, the system can simply load the material file and reapply the
                    variables and
                    textures as needed, streamlining the shader management process.

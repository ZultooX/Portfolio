                <a>
                    TGA offers a course were the student gets to specialize in an area in which they are intrested in.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    So I decided to specialize in procedural animations and developing an Inverse Kinematics alghoritm
                    using the
                    FABRIK (Forward And Backwards Reaching Inverse Kinematics) method.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    And with the finished inverse kinematics I wanted to recreate the subtle hand animations from
                    Uncharted 4: A Thief's End.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I made the project in my own custom C++ DirectX11 game engine.

                <a>
                    The implementation of the position solving was straight forward. Perform the passes a number of
                    iterations. But I found that a single iteration is enough for my joint chain. But for larger joint
                    chains more iterations was needed.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    And you can also set a flag in the chain to decide if it should use the target local to its own
                    space, set it so it uses world space and the models transform.

                <a>
                    The FABRIK algorithm operates in two key passes to adjust joint positions efficiently:
                </a>

                <div class="subtitle">Backward Pass</div>
                <a>
                    The chain starts from the end effector and moves backward toward the root. This step ensures that
                    the
                    end effector reaches the target while maintaining segment lengths.
                </a>

                <div class="subtitle">Forward Pass</div>
                <a>
                    The chain then moves forward, repositioning joints while keeping the root in place. This step
                    restores
                    the structure while maintaining the target alignment.

                <a>
                    The SolveRotation step in FABRIK adjusts joint rotations after their positions are updated. It
                    iterates through each joint (except the last) to align it with the next joint in the chain. For the
                    last joint, it adjusts its rotation to face the target position.

                    <br>
                    Using quaternions ensures smooth rotations and avoids problems like gimbal lock, maintaining both
                    correct positions and natural orientations.

                <div class="title">Why FABRIK?</div>
                <a>
                    I chose to use FABRIK since it was more suitable and optimized for game development. But even though
                    the alghoritm was more suited for games, it still came with a big flaw.
                    <br>
                    It only works with positions, so rotations is needed to be calculated manually.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    FABRIK also seemed to be the simplest method to implement, which fits into the short timeframe in
                    which the course lasts.

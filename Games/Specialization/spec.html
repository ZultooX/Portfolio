                <div class="title">Procedural Animations Using FABRIK</div>
                <a>
                    TGA offers a course were the student gets to specialize in an area in which they are intrested in.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    So I to specialize in procedural animations and developing an Inverse Kinematics alghoritm using the
                    FABRIK (Forward And Backwards Reaching Inverse Kinematics) method.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    And with the finished inverse kinematics I wanted to recreate the subtle hand animations from
                    Uncharted 4: A Thief's End.

                <div class="title">Why FABRIK?</div>
                <a>
                    I chose to use FABRIK since it was more suitable and optimized for game development. But even though
                    the alghoritm was more suited for games, it still came with a big flaw.
                    <br>
                    It only works with positions, so rotations is needed to be calculated manually.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    FABRIK also seemed to be the simplest method to implement, which fits into the short timeframe in
                    which the course lasts.

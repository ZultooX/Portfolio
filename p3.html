                    This project quickly became one of my favorites, especially because it marked the transition from
                    working in Unity to The Game Assembly’s custom C++ engine, TGE. Unlike commercial engines, TGE came
                    with very limited built-in systems, which meant we had to build many features from the ground
                    up—including animation, rendering, and physics.

                    <br><br>

                    Working in this kind of low-level environment was challenging, but also incredibly rewarding. It
                    forced me to deeply understand how game systems function under the hood and pushed me to solve
                    problems I would normally rely on an engine to handle for me. That hands-on experience gave me a
                    much stronger grasp of both C++ and engine architecture, and it made every solution feel truly
                    earned.

                <a>
                    My goal was to implement a system that would be easy to use for my team members. I could reach that
                    goal thanks to ES which was the name our component system was given.

                    Im not sure what to write since ive forgotten most of the system

                <a>
                    I wanted to make character controller that feels good and natural, so I wanted to make a physics
                    based character controller. But since the engine dont have a physics engine implemented I had to
                    take actions into my own hands and implement an engine which only applies force to objects,
                    therefore the name Force Engine.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    This force engine would also make it easier to separate colliders from eachother by simple applying
                    a force.

                <a>
                    I want to create a movement system where the player accelerates smoothly in the direction of input
                    while maintaining a maximum speed. The movement should feel responsive, but also natural, with a
                    slight inertia effect when changing directions. Additionally, if no input is given, the player
                    should gradually slow down instead of stopping abruptly. This will make movement feel fluid and more
                    dynamic.

                    This project is my favorite since it was the first were we didnt use Unity and instead used TGA's
                    inhouse engine. Some of my contributions to this project is:

                    My goal was to implement a system that would be easy to use for my team members. I could reach that
                    goal thanks to ES which was the name our component system was given.

                    Im not sure what to write since ive forgotten most of the system

                <a>
                    I wanted to make character controller that feels good and natural, so I wanted to make a physics
                    based character controller. But since the engine dont have a physics engine implemented I had to
                    take actions into my own hands and implement an engine which only applies force to objects,
                    therefore the name Force Engine.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    This force engine would also make it easier to separate colliders from eachother by simple applying
                    a force.

                <a>
                    I want to create a movement system where the player accelerates smoothly in the direction of input
                    while maintaining a maximum speed. The movement should feel responsive, but also natural, with a
                    slight inertia effect when changing directions. Additionally, if no input is given, the player
                    should gradually slow down instead of stopping abruptly. This will make movement feel fluid and more
                    dynamic.
